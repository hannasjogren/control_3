Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing an IMDB database through an interactive web application built with Streamlit. The goal is to explore IMDB data, identify patterns and trends in the film industry, and present key insights in an intuitive way. The database is used to run SQL queries and generate visualizations that facilitate analysis.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

- IMDB.db – An SQLite database containing IMDB data.
  
- A folder with IMDB-related files and scripts for analysis and visualization.
  
- Streamlit web application (page.py):
A page focusing on investment opportunities based on the data.
A dashboard presenting key insights and visualizations.

-Analysis and visualization scripts (page.py, structured into different modules with specific functions):
Movie Genres – Analyzes and visualizes popular genres, their evolution over time, and insights related to filmmaking.
Actors – Explores actors' careers, their most successful movies, and trends in film roles.
Time-Based Trends – Examines how the film industry has evolved over time, including production rates, popularity shifts, and genre preferences.

By combining database analysis with interactive visualization, this project provides a deeper understanding of the film industry's development and opportunities.
